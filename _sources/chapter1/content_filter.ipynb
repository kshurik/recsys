    "# Content-based Filtering in a Nutshell\n",
    "In this section, we will go through a straightforward way to generate candidates for recommendations.\n",
    "As we mentioned before, one of the methods is *content-based* filtering. We will go through an explanation of\n",
    "this method with an example and finally discuss a particular library to implement it.\n",
    "Before that, we have to define and understand embeddings. As you might have noticed, we mentioned a lot\n",
    "\"similar items\", \"similar users\" etc and the question arises -- how do we define that similarity?\n",
    "Speaking of the calculation of similarity it is pretty straightforward -- we calculate cosine between two arrays.\n",
    "The intriguing part is how we get these arrays from our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Embeddings Explained\n",
    "The evolution of text processing started from one-hot encoding. When there was text data, Data Scientists\n",
    "would preprocess them (lower case, remove symbols, etc.) and then create one-hot representations of words or\n",
    "n-grams (when we split words/text into 2-3-...-n parts by characters). Finally, use some ML model on top of it.\n",
    "Notwithstanding the fact of easiness and interpretability of this approach, human language is sophisticated\n",
    "and various words can mean different meanings depending on the context and such a technique fails in most cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, embeddings have become the next stage in the text processing pipeline. It is the type of word representation\n",
    "that allows words with similar meanings to have a similar representation. Unlike methods such as one-hot encoding,\n",
    "word embeddings provide a way to represent words in a more meaningful way, by mapping them to a vector of real\n",
    "numbers in a continuous vector space. The idea behind word embedding is to use a neural network to learn\n",
    "relationships between words in a dataset. The neural network is trained to assign a numeric vector to each word\n",
    "in the dataset. Typically, the vector is of fixed length and the goal is to find a vector that accurately\n",
    "represents the meaning of the word, in the context of the dataset. This allows for words in similar contexts\n",
    "to have similar vector representations. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine a dataset of movie reviews. Let’s say that the neural network has been trained to assign\n",
    "a vector to each word in the dataset. If the word “amazing” is used in a movie review, then the vector assigned\n",
    "to “amazing” will be similar to the vector assigned to “incredible”. This is because the meanings of these two\n",
    "words are similar and they are often used in similar contexts. Word embeddings can also be used to identify\n",
    "relationships between words. For example, consider the words “man” and “woman”. If the neural network assigned\n",
    "similar vectors to these two words, this would indicate that the two words are related.  In addition to\n",
    "identifying relationships between words, word embeddings can also be used to classify documents. For example,\n",
    "if a document contains the words “amazing” and “incredible”, then the neural network can assign an appropriate\n",
    "vector to each of these words. If a second document contains similar words, then the neural network can assign\n",
    "similar vectors to these words. This allows the neural network to accurately classify the documents as being similar. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, word embeddings can be used for data visualization. By plotting the vectors assigned to words in\n",
    "a two-dimensional space, it is possible to see how words are related. This can be a useful tool for understanding\n",
    "the relationships between words in a given dataset. In summary, word embeddings are a powerful tool\n",
    "for representing words in a meaningful way. They can be used to identify relationships between words,\n",
    "classify documents, and visualize data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's consider *content-based filtering* and use simple Word2Vec/Doc2Vec\n",
    "model to get such recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Content-based Filtering\n",
    "Content-based filtering can be used in a variety of applications, from recommending films and music to suggesting\n",
    "restaurants and travel destinations. In this part, we'll discuss how content-based filtering works and provide\n",
    "some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Content-based filtering is a type of recommender system that recommends items to users based on their past\n",
    "preferences and behaviors. It works by analyzing a user's preferences, in terms of attributes such as genre,\n",
    "director, actor, or even a combination of these, and then recommending other items that have similar attributes.\n",
    "For example, if a user has previously watched romantic comedies with Julia Roberts, content-based filtering\n",
    "would recommend other romantic comedies with Julia Roberts, or other films featuring similar actors or directors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Content-based filtering is based on the assumption that users who liked one item will likely like similar items.\n",
    "To generate recommendations, the system first identifies the attributes of the items that the user has previously\n",
    "interacted with. It then identifies other items that have similar attributes and recommends them to the user.\n",
    "For example, if a user has previously listened to Taylor Swift songs, the system will identify other Taylor Swift\n",
    "songs as well as songs with similar attributes, such as a similar genre or artist. In industry, this type of\n",
    "recommendation is shown with \"Similar to ...\". It is an additional nudge to increase the interest of a user\n",
    "as recommendations with explanations seem to be personalized from the user's point of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, content-based filtering is a type of recommender system that recommends items to users based on their\n",
    "past preferences and behaviors. Next, we jump to the coding part and create a simple Word2Vec model via [`gensim`](https://pypi.org/project/gensim/) library.\n",
    "Well-explained the logic of the Word2Vec model you can find [here](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/).\n",
    "Here, we will not discuss the details of implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### gensim: example of content-based recommendations based on Doc2Vec approach\n",
    "Now, we move on to the implementation of a content-based recommender using `gensim` library and Doc2Vec. It is almost\n",
    "the same as Word2Vec with slight modifications, but the idea remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
