# Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering is a powerful method for recommendation systems used to predict user preferences or
interests. It is based on the notion that people who have similar tastes and preferences in one domain are likely
to have similar tastes and preferences in a different domain. The collaborative filtering technique seeks to identify
users who have similar tastes and preferences, based on their past interactions, and then use those users'
interactions of items to predict the relevance of similar items for the user. The goal of collaborative filtering is
to use the opinions of other people to make predictions about a user’s preferences and interests.
This is done by finding users who have similar tastes and preferences as the user in question, and then using
those users’ ratings of items to make predictions about how the user would rate the same items.
There are two main approaches to collaborative filtering: memory-based and model-based. 

## Memory-based Collaborative Filtering
Memory-based collaborative filtering, also known as neighborhood-based collaborative filtering, is an approach
that relies on finding similar users or items based on their behavior or preferences. The basic idea is to use
the ratings or interactions of users with items to identify other users who have similar tastes, and then use
the ratings of those similar users to make recommendations to a target user. One common approach in memory-based
collaborative filtering is user-based collaborative filtering. In this approach, the similarity between users is
calculated based on their ratings for items. A similarity metric such as the cosine similarity or Pearson correlation
coefficient is often used to measure the similarity between two users. The similarity scores are then used to
identify the most similar users to the target user. Once the most similar users are identified, their ratings
for items are used to generate recommendations for the target user. Item-based collaborative filtering is another
common approach in memory-based collaborative filtering. In this approach, the similarity between items is calculated
based on the ratings of users who have rated both items. The similarity scores are then used to identify items that
are similar to the items that the target user has already rated highly. Once similar items are identified,
they are recommended to the target user. One advantage of memory-based collaborative filtering is that it is easy
to implement and interpret. The algorithm is relatively simple and does not require a lot of computational resources.
Additionally, memory-based collaborative filtering can be effective when there is a lot of data available and the
user-item matrix is sparse. However, memory-based collaborative filtering also has several disadvantages.
One major limitation is that it is prone to the cold-start problem, which occurs when there is not enough data
available to identify similar users or items. Additionally, memory-based collaborative filtering can be
computationally expensive when there are a large number of users or items.

Let's consider an example with Pearson Correlation
Say, we have a dataset that contains the ratings of four users on five movies. The data looks like this:

|         | User A | User B | User C | User D |
|-------- | -------- | ------- | ------- | -------- |
|Movie 1 | 5 | 4 | 2 | 3 | 
|Movie 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 
|Movie 3 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 |
|Movie 4 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 |
|Movie 5 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 3 |


To apply collaborative filtering, we can compute the similarity between each pair of users based on their 
ratings. The similarity is calculated using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC). The PCC is a measure
of how well two sets of data are correlated, and it ranges from -1 (perfectly negatively correlated) to +1
(perfectly positively correlated). For example, let’s assume that we want to find the similarity between
User A and User B. The PCC is calculated by taking the average of the product of the ratings for each movie.
So, let's get PCC for User A and User B:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np

user_a = [5, 3, 4, 1, 2]
user_b = [4, 3, 4, 2, 1]

print(f'Pearson Correlation for user A and B is: {np.corrcoef(user_a, user_b)[0, 1]}')
```

It indicates that `User A` and `User B` have a strong positive correlation in their ratings.
To find recommendations for `User A`, we can first identify the users who are most similar to `User A`.
In this example, that would be `User B` and `User C` (check it out by calculating other pairs).
Next, we can take the weighted average of the ratings from those users for the movies that `User A`
has not yet been rated. For example, let’s assume that `User A` has not yet rated Movie 4. We can then take
the weighted average of the ratings for Movie 4 from `User B` and `User C`.  `User B` rated Movie 4 a 2,
and `User C` rated it a 1. We can then take the weighted average of those ratings, giving more weight 
to `User B` since they are more similar to `User A`. In this case, the weighted average would be around 2.
Therefore, based on the ratings from other users, it is likely that `User A` would rate Movie 4 a 2.

To wrap up, we can say that memory-based collaborative filtering is about calculating the similarity
between rows or columns of the interaction matrix. In our example, we took columns a.k.a user similarities
while we could take item-item similarities and use them as recommendation.


## Model-based Collaborative Filtering
Model-based collaborative filtering is an approach that uses machine learning algorithms to learn a model from 
the ratings or interactions of users with items. The model is then used to make predictions about the relevance of
users for items that they have not yet interacted with. One common approach in model-based collaborative filtering
is matrix factorization. In this approach, the user-item matrix is decomposed into two lower-dimensional matrices:
a user matrix and an item matrix. The user matrix represents the latent preferences of users, and the item matrix
represents the latent attributes of items. The dot product of the user and item matrices gives the predicted relevance
for a user-item pair. Matrix factorization is typically performed using a technique called Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
An example of how it is computed is shown below. We have interactions data where rows represent
users and columns their ratings/other interactions. Based on that we have found such matrices that would approximate
this relationship from our interactions data. It is worth mentioning, that by SVD we only try to approximate rather
than being able to restore the interactions matrix fully. Thus, we take *k* biggest singular values from the sigma (middle) matrix

![](img/svd_example.png)
*Toy example with SVD decomposition*

Also, there are some peculiarities with SVD:
- It is not that good to predict values to rank (if we consider it a regression problem)
- Quite good for the generation of top-N candidates for further reranking:
classically, for user and item embeddings we calculate the dot product and choose top-N by its value.

However, SVD is computationally expensive and may not scale well to large datasets.
Therefore, alternative techniques such as Alternating Least Squares (ALS) or modification for
implicit target iALS, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) are often used. Another common approach
in model-based collaborative filtering is deep learning. In this approach, a neural network
is used to learn a representation of users and items. The network takes as input the ratings
or interactions of users with items and outputs a prediction of the rating for a user-item pair.
Deep learning has the advantage of being able to capture complex patterns in the data and can be used
to learn non-linear relationships between users and items. One of the popular examples is Extreme Deep Factorization machines (xDeepFM).

One advantage of model-based collaborative filtering is that it can handle the cold-start problem by using the
learned model to make predictions about items that have not yet been rated by users. Additionally, model-based
collaborative filtering can be more accurate than memory-based collaborative filtering, especially when there are
a large number of users and items. If we have enough data we can generate more accurate predictions minimizing our loss function

However, model-based collaborative filtering also has some disadvantages. One major limitation is that it can be
difficult to interpret the learned model and understand why certain recommendations are being made. Additionally,
model-based collaborative filtering can be computationally expensive and may require a lot of computational resources,
especially when using deep learning techniques. Another disadvantage of model-based collaborative filtering is that it
requires a large amount of data to train the model effectively. This can be a challenge in some domains, where there
may be a limited amount of data available. In these cases, memory-based collaborative filtering may be a better choice.
However, there are several methods are available in Python for faster computations. Below, you can see several libraries
that deal with SVD 

```{code-cell} ipython3
from scipy.sparse.linalg import svds
from sklearn.utils.extmath import randomized_svd
from sklearn.decomposition import TruncatedSVD
```

Besides, `SVD` we other matrix factorization techniques that use loss optimization. These are
Alternating Least Squares (`ALS`) and implicit Alternating least squares  (`iALS`).


`ALS` is an optimization algorithm used in collaborative filtering and designed to factorize a user-item
interaction matrix into two lower-dimensional matrices, one representing users and the other representing
items, while minimizing the reconstruction error. The algorithm works by alternating between fixing one
matrix and optimizing the other. The loss function to train the model is the following:

$\begin{align}
L_{explicit} = \sum\limits_{u,i \in S}( r_{ui} - x_{u} y_{i}^{T} )^{2} + \lambda \big( \sum\limits_{u} \left \Vert x_{u} \right \Vert^{2} + \sum\limits_{i} \left \Vert y_{i} \right \Vert^{2} \big)
\end{align}$

Where:
- $r_{ui}$ is the true rating given by user $u$ to the item $i$;
- $x_u$ and $y_i$ are user u's and item i's latent factors, both are $1×d$ dimensional, where $d$ the number of latent factors that the user can specify;
- $S$ was the set of all user-item ratings;
- $\lambda$ controls the regularization strength that prevents overfitting the user and item vectors

As an example, let's say we have a user-item matrix where each row represents a user and each column represents an item.
The entries in the matrix correspond to user-item interactions, such as ratings or watch history. To factorize
this matrix using ALS, we first initialize the user and item matrices with random values. We then fix the item matrix and optimize the user matrix by minimizing the reconstruction error. We repeat this process by fixing the user matrix
and optimizing the item matrix until the reconstruction error converges to a minimum.


`iALS` is a modification of `ALS` that is designed to handle implicit feedback data, such as user clicks. In this case, the user-item interaction matrix only contains binary values indicating whether a user has interacted with an item or not. The algorithm works by incorporating a confidence weighting scheme that assigns higher weights to items that have been interacted with more frequently. As in the previous example, we repeat almost the same steps. However, in the process, we calculate the confidence weights for each item based on its interaction count. Then, we go on with minimizing the reconstruction error while taking into account the confidence weights.

## Other Python Implementations
To conclude, I want to mention several methods for implementation before focusing on the target `implicit` library.
The first one is `implicit` which allows building models based on implicit targets. In addition,
it has several frequently used models:
- Item-to-Item KNN. Sometimes it is hard to generate recommendations based on user interaction due to the dynamic
nature of their data (good real-time/near real-time data and model update is required). Thus, this method
is a good kick-off point for candidate generation. KNN does not make any assumptions on the
underlying data distribution but it relies on item feature similarity;
- Logistic matrix factorization. It resembles the classic logit model where the collaborative filtering recommender tries to
learn probabilistic distribution whether the user like recommendations;
- implicit ALS. It is used when the amount of data is quite big and provides good performance by reducing
the impact of missing data using confidence and preference metrics;
- Bayesian Personalized Ranking. Its optimization relies on instance level - one item instead of item pairs. The
the primary goal of the method is to provide a personalized list of recommendations directly

Another one is the library we were going to use in the tutorial - `lightfm` (but in reality the maintenance of the
library is not that good -- so I decided to switch to `implicit`). The main idea of the method
is to generate feature vectors for both users and items by aggregating the values of features. The method assumes
that the final `user embedding vector` is the sum of each of the user’s relevant side information
vectors (which we called user features) and similarly `item embedding vector` is created.
It is quite fast as developed in Cython. The model has several losses and optimizes parameters using Stochastic
Gradient Descent (SGD) with options `adagrad` or `adadelta` - great explanation
of the method can be found [here](https://code.themlsbook.com/chapter3/gradient_descent.html). The losses are:
- Logistic;
- Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BRP);
- Weighted Approximate-Rank Pairwise (WARP);
- k-os WARP

Now, let's move on to Python implementation

    data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

    return data
```
### 2. Main
#### 2.1. Load Data
`interactions` dataset shows list of movies that users watched, along with given ratings:

```{code-cell} ipython3
# interactions data
interactions = read_csv_from_gdrive(RATINGS_SMALL_URL)
interactions.head()
```
`movies_metadata` dataset shows the list of movies existing on OKKO platform:

```{code-cell} ipython3
# information about films etc
movies_metadata = read_csv_from_gdrive(MOVIES_METADATA_URL)
movies_metadata.head(3)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# convert to the same data type ids to filter
movies_metadata['id'] = movies_metadata['id'].astype(str)
interactions['movieId'] = interactions['movieId'].astype(str)
```
Filter only intersection of available movies in both datasets
```{code-cell} ipython3
# leave only those films that intersect with each other
interactions_filtered = interactions.loc[interactions['movieId'].isin(movies_metadata['id'])]
print(interactions.shape, interactions_filtered.shape)
```

#### 2.2 Data preparation
To use implicit kNN method `fit` we need a sparse matrix in COOrdinate format. To achieve that we will use `scipy.sparse.coo_matrix` from scipy;

```{code-cell} ipython3
def get_coo_matrix(
        df: pd.DataFrame, 
        user_col: str,
        item_col: str, 
        users_mapping: dict, 
        movies_mapping: dict,
        weight_col: str = None
        ):
    if weight_col is None:
        weights = np.ones(len(df), dtype=np.float32)
    else:
        weights = df[weight_col].astype(np.float32)
    interaction_matrix = sp.coo_matrix((
        weights, 
        (
            df[user_col].map(users_mapping.get), 
            df[item_col].map(movies_mapping.get)
        )
    ))
    return interaction_matrix
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# define users mapping
users_inv_mapping = dict(enumerate(interactions_filtered['userId'].unique()))
users_mapping = {v: k for k, v in users_inv_mapping.items()}
len(users_mapping)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# define movies mapping
movies_inv_mapping = dict(enumerate(interactions_filtered['movieId'].unique()))
movies_mapping = {v: k for k, v in movies_inv_mapping.items()}
len(movies_mapping)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# defining train set on the whole interactions dataset (as HW you will have to split into test and train for evaluation)
train_mat = get_coo_matrix(
    interactions_filtered,
    user_col = 'userId',
    item_col = 'movieId',
    users_mapping = users_mapping,
    movies_mapping = movies_mapping
    ).tocsr()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
train_mat
```

#### 2.3. Model Training & Evaluation
In [`implicit`](https://pypi.org/project/implicit/), there are various models and can be groupped into:
- Item-to-Item: KNN based on various similarities - CosineRecommender, BM25Recommender, TFIDFRecommender
- implicit ALS;
- Logistic Matrix Factorization;
- Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)

##### 2.3.1. Train Model

```{code-cell} ipython3
from implicit.nearest_neighbours import (
    CosineRecommender,
    BM25Recommender,
    TFIDFRecommender
    )
```
Note that in item-to-item models we need to provide matrix in the form of item-user by transposing initial COO matrix user-item
```{code-cell} ipython3
# fit the model
cosine_model = CosineRecommender(K = 20)
cosine_model.fit(train_mat.T)
```

##### 2.3.2. Evaluate the Model

```{code-cell} ipython3
# let's make sense-check
top_N = 10
user_id = interactions_filtered['userId'].iloc[0]
row_id = users_mapping[user_id]
print(f'Rekko for user {user_id}, row number in matrix - {row_id}')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# create mapper for movieId and title names
movie_name_mapper = dict(zip(movies_metadata['id'], movies_metadata['original_title']))
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
recs = cosine_model.recommend(
    row_id,
    train_mat,
    N = top_N,
    filter_already_liked_items = True
    )
recs = pd.DataFrame(recs).T.rename(columns = {0: 'col_id', 1: 'similarity'})
recs['inv_movie_id'] = recs['col_id'].astype(int)
recs['movieId'] = recs['inv_movie_id'].map(movies_inv_mapping.get)
recs['title'] = recs['movieId'].map(movie_name_mapper)
recs
```

## Hybrid Approaches
In practice, many recommender systems use a hybrid approach that combines both memory-based and model-based
collaborative filtering. In a hybrid approach, the strengths of both approaches are leveraged to improve the
accuracy and performance of the recommender system. One common approach in hybrid collaborative filtering is
to use a memory-based approach to generate initial recommendations and then refine the recommendations using
a model-based approach. This approach can be effective in situations where there is not enough data to train
a model effectively but there is enough data to identify similar users or items using a memory-based approach.
Another approach is to use a model-based approach to generate initial recommendations and then refine the
recommendations using a memory-based approach. This approach can be effective in situations where the user-item
matrix is very sparse and a model-based approach is needed to make accurate predictions.
