# Introduction to Product Analytics
This chapter covers what is product analytics and how it is done - its role, tools,
types of researches and how it helps to optimize ranking and recommendation models.

In today's data-driven world, businesses rely on insights derived from data to drive
decision-making and improve product performance. Product analytics is a vital discipline
that involves the measurement, analysis, and interpretation of user behavior within a
product or service. By leveraging data, businesses can gain valuable insights into user
engagement, conversion rates, and overall product effectiveness. This chapter focuses on 
the application of product analytics specifically for ranking and recommendation models,
exploring the techniques and methodologies used to evaluate and optimize these essential
components of user experiences. This discipline helps you to understand “who” did “what,
when, and where.” It complements qualitative methods and tools that helps you understand
“why and how” a user did something while interacting with your product.


This tool helps data people and, consecutively, business to get inshigts on:
- What aspects of product users engage with;
- What are the bottlenecks to improve the product;
- What are opportunities to reach a ceratin business goal;
- What are general patterns of successful/unsuccessful fearure;

## The Role of Product Analytics
Product analytics encompasses a wide range of practices and methodologies aimed at
understanding and optimizing user experiences. It involves the collection and analysis
of data to gain insights into user behavior, preferences, and interactions with the product.
Product analytics enables businesses to make data-driven decisions, identify areas
for improvement, and drive product enhancements. It encompasses various aspects, including:

1. Dashboards and Visualizations: Product analytics often involves creating interactive
dashboards and visualizations that provide a comprehensive view of key metrics and performance
indicators. These visual representations allow stakeholders to monitor the product's performance
in real-time and quickly identify trends, anomalies, and areas for improvement.

2. Monitoring and Alerting: Continuous monitoring of key metrics and user behavior is crucial
for effective product analytics. Monitoring systems help track user interactions, identify 
performance issues, and alert the relevant teams when anomalies occur. This proactive approach
enables businesses to address issues promptly and ensure optimal user experiences.

3. Metrics Tree: A metrics tree is a hierarchical structure that defines the key metrics and
goals of the product. It provides a framework for measuring the product's performance and
aligning it with the organization's objectives. By breaking down high-level goals into specific
metrics, businesses can gain a deeper understanding of the factors that contribute to the
success of their ranking and recommendation models.

In addition, there are another vital drivers to get valuable knowledge via different types
of researches like:
- `Funnel analysis` - classic task which aims to show you data on the passthrough and conversion
of users who have gone through a funnel you define (with a various starting point like
 signup, onboarding, activation, purchase, click etc.);

- `Growth analysis` -  that help you visualize sources of user growth (e.g., breakdown
of your weekly user base by new, current, dormant vs. churned users), including where
users came from (i.e., acquisition sources). Aggregate engagement stats show insights
into active users, and frequency and duration of sessions (e.g., DAU, WAU, MAU, stickiness, session length);

- `Retention and churn` - it is a critical to product growth and various methodologies
can be applied: n-period, unbound, bracketed periods (what percentage of users come back
to my product next week/month etc.). Retention is a lagging indicator of habituation and
a leading indicator of desired results such as customer satisfaction or virality rate;

- `User/evenet segmentation` - user segementation aims to to understand who your users are and
what they have in common (for example, percentage of users in a geography, using a certain platform
or device, social-demographics such as gender, age, status). Event segmentation depicts aggregate
stats on user actions (for instance, number of registrations, subscriptions, number of movies interacted);

- `Clickstream` - individual user details to see chronological order of actions that a user took
and CRM-like capabilities to show details on the user cumulative actions until some state is achieved;

- `Financial metrics` - it includes customer acquisition cost (CAC) per channel or campaign,
customer lifetime value (CLV), Gross Merchandise Value (GMV), Contribution etc.

This list is not limited to these metrics, but generally this is a good starting point
to execute your researches. Overall, you can think of product analytics of three steps:

1. `Data collection` - extracting, processing and managing raw data;
2. `Analysis` -  allows data person to define the goal of analysis to
generate thoroguhg report;
3. `Reporting` - converting conclusions and action points to make data driven decisions
on how to proceed with product/service improvements

In practice, most end users will focus on what you have in step 3. The result can
be in various forms like report document, dashboard, metrics table with interpreation.


## Optimizing Ranking and Recommendation Models
Product analytics not only provides insights into model performance but also offers valuable
guidance for optimizing ranking and recommendation algorithms. By analyzing user behavior, 
feedback, and performance metrics, organizations can make data-driven decisions to improve
the relevance and effectiveness of their models. Some key strategies for optimization include:

1. A/B Testing: Conducting controlled experiments by comparing different versions of ranking
and recommendation models to identify the most effective approach. A/B testing helps evaluate
the impact of changes and improvements on key metrics and allows for data-driven decision-making.

2. User Feedback Analysis: Collecting and analyzing user feedback, such as ratings, reviews,
and surveys, provides valuable insights into user preferences and satisfaction. This feedback
can be used to tailor and refine the ranking and recommendation algorithms to better meet user needs.

3. Continuous Monitoring and Iterative Improvement: Implementing robust monitoring systems
to track user interactions, evaluate model performance over time, and identify areas for improvement.
By continuously analyzing data and iterating on the models, businesses can refine their algorithms
to deliver more accurate and relevant recommendations.

4. Feature Engineering: Iteratively improving the input features of the ranking and recommendation
models based on user feedback and observed patterns. Feature engineering involves selecting, 
transforming, and creating relevant features that enhance the performance of the models.

# Summary
Product analytics serves as a powerful tool for evaluating and optimizing ranking and recommendation
models. By leveraging metrics, dashboards, monitoring systems, and user feedback analysis,
businesses can gain valuable insights into user behavior, measure model performance,
and make data-driven decisions
